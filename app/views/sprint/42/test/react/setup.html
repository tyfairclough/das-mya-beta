            <p>I am trying to discover if users can find anomolies in their password entry quicker than they can read similar length and types of words</p>
            <p>The experiment aims to prove that a user can identify an issue in a pattern of words quicker than a third party can understand those words when spelt correctly.</p>
            <p>The aim is to build a 'peek' feature on a password input that visibly shows a user their password only for as long as they need to see it, making it impossible for a user to use over the shoulder tactics to steal the password. Even taking a photo would require the hacker to capture an image with split second reaction times. A video would be required and as in entering a pin people should/can protect their input from prolonged view. This statement makes it clear this is not a solution but an enhancement to an issue that plagues many a user in their day to day lives.</p>
