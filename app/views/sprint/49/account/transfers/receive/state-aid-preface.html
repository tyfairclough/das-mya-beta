<h2 id="Definitions">Background</h2>
<p>In order to minimise distortion of competition the European Commission sets the limits on how much assistance can be given without its prior approval to organisations operating in a competitive market. This letter sets out what is needed to ensure compliance with those limits. You should note carefully the requirements and the obligations. If you have any queries please discuss them with the aid administrator.
</p>
    
    <p>
        Under EC Regulation 1407/2013 (De Minimis Aid Regulation) as published in the Official Journal of the European Union 24 December 2013<sup>42</sup>, the support provided is a De minimis aid. There is a ceiling of €200,000 [€100,000 for undertakings in the road freight transport sector] for all De minimis aid provided to any one organisation over a three fiscal year period (i.e. your current fiscal year and previous two discal years). Any De minimis aid provided to you under this scheme will be relevant if you wish to apply, or have applied for any other De minimis aid. The value of the aid under this scheme is (or estimated to be by caculating the gross grant equivalent). You will need to declare this amount to any other aid awarding body who requests information from you on how much De minimis aid you have received. For the purposes of the De minimis regulation, you must retain this letter for 10 years from the date on which the aid is granted and produce it on any request by the UK public authorities or the European Comission. (You may need to keep this letter longer than 10 years)
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>Please advise us now of any other De minimis aid</strong> which your enterprise and any enterprises linked to it may have received during your current and previous two fiscal years, as we need to check that our support added to that previously received, will not exceed the threshold of €200,000 (€100,000 for undertakings in the road freight transport sector) over the last 3 fiscal years. De Minimis Aid includes not only grant but also assistance such as free or subsidised consultancy services, marketing advice etc. If you are in any doubt about whether previous assistance received classes as De minimis assistance please include it.</p>
